          <li>Event: An instance of wildlife trafficking e.g. a seizure or arrest</li>
          <li>Product: The specific part of an animal being trafficked e.g., the skin or tooth of an animal.</li>
          <ul> The product may be left raw such as an elephant tusk, or process such as a piece of elephant ivory</ul>

      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        This project was created by three Worcester Polytechnic Institute computer science majors for their Major Qualifying Project (MQP): 
        Devin Coughlin ('22), Maylee Gagnon ('22), and Victoria Grasso ('22).
        Also a special thank you to faculty advisors, Professor Kyumin Lee and Professor Renata Konrad, graduate student advisor, 
        Guanyi Mou, and sponsors, Meredith Gore and Patricia Raxter for all their help and guidance during this project.
      </p>
      <h3>Project Goals</h3>
      <p>
        The International Consortium on Combating Wildlife Crime, a leading expert, defines wildlife trafficking as “the taking, trading 
        (supplying, selling or trafficking), importing, exporting, and processing, possessing, obtaining and consumption of wild fauna and flora, 
        including timber and other forest products, in contravention of national or international law” (Wildlife Crime | CITES, n.d.). One 
        organization, Eco Activists for Governance and Law Enforcement (EAGLE), aims to impede wildlife trafficking and related corruption 
        through civic activism and collaborating with governments. They do so through investigations, arrests, prosecutions, and publicity. 
        The organization covers nine countries, Cameroon, Congo, Gabon, Togo, Senegal, Benin, Côte D’Ivoire, Burkina Faso, and Uganda. 
        EAGLE releases monthly briefings containing details of their recent work including seizures and wildlife trafficker arrests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sifting through the EAGLE releases is tedious work for those combating wildlife trafficking such as law enforcement, 
        government agencies, and researchers. There can be many seizures happening within one country over one month so those combating 
        wildlife trafficking have a lot of data to keep track of and read through. Therefore our goal for this MQP was to design and develop a 
        pipeline to extract data from the EAGLE reports and effectively display the data to help experts in the field examine instances of 
        wildlife trafficking.
        The Dashboard tab of this website displays the data we extracted from EAGLE articles.

      <h3>Data and Resources</h3>
      <p>
        As stated above, Eco Activists for Governance and Law Enforcement (EAGLE), aims to impede wildlife trafficking and related corruption 
        through civic activism and collaborating with governments. We utilize their monthly reports to generate visualizations that show law enforcement, 
        government agencies, and researchers an overview of the data. The link below leads to EAGLE's website.
